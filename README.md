YT-RSS-Downloader
=================

A simple Youtube RSS fetcher to stay updated on the newest videos of your beloved channels!


## About
Everyone loves YouTube.
And most of the people that use it also know, that it's not always about the funny cat videos or other things.

I for example use it for music.
There are a lot of music-channels on YouTube and I love to see that they upload new videos / songs.

But... It's hard to keep track and stay up2date with them on my local hard-drive.
That's when I came up with this app!

## Okay... so, what does it do?
Basicly, you can add your favorite channels in the app and fetch the newest videos since the last time you checked for updates through the app.
Upon fetching either a single channel or all at once the app get's the last date you checked for updates and compares that to the channel /-s.
If there are any new videos, it saves them in the sub-folder "channels" (from where you run the app) as a text-document named like the channel.

## How do I use it?
First off, I'd advise you to put the downloaded release into a new folder, e.g. "Youtube RSS" or something. You decide that.
Next, you start it up.
It creates a sub-folder called "channels" automaticly.
Now, the fancy part: Add all the channels you want!
Click the "Add Channel" button and it prompts you to enter the Youtube Channel name.
It can either be the user (check the channel info on the YouTube channel) or some unique channel name, like "UC7tD6Ifrwbiy-BoaAHEinmQ".
Upon adding the channel, the app is checking if it's a valid channel.
If it's not, you get a notification that the channel is not valid.

You can repeat this as often as you want.
Keep in mind, the more channels you have, the longer the app will take to update when you fetch all the channels at once.

Now, you have 2 options.
Either fetch a single channel or all of them at the same time.

Either way, it might appear that the app is stuck and doesn't respond.
Give it some time, it is fetching the newest videos of the channel /-s.

When it's done, you get a small notification telling you that either the channels have got no new videos or they do.
If it's the case that there are new videos, the links of these are getting saved into a text-document in the sub-folder "channels" named like the corresponding channel.

What you do with these links is not my problem, but I am pretty sure that we all know, what you're going to do ;)

## That's all?
That's all.

## Hey, I've found a bug!
Great, go make a _detailed_ issue :P
